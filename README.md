CryptoSphere 2019
=================

The CryptoSphere is an educational concept developed at the University
of Copenhagen, where students can experiment with alternative methods
for human computer interaction.

The concept has been developed as part of the FemTech project, read
more about FemTech at [http://femtech.dk].

Concept
-------
[Introduction to the CryptoSphere concept](http://www.femtech.dk/cryptosphere-open-design-community/)

Materials
---------
 - A flamingo/polystyren ball/sphere (10cm diameter)
 - LED strip with 8 LEDs
 - [Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13804) (important, don't buy ESP8266 Thing, it needs to be the Dev version!)
 - [Sparkfun LSM9DS1 motion sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13284)
 - A microUSB cable
 - A Facebook account

Tutorial
--------
 1. [Installation](http://www.femtech.dk/cryptosphere-open-design-community/01-installing-arduino-ide-sparkfun-thing-dev-board-esp8266-library-folders-for-programming-ledstrips-and-accelerometer/)
 
   - Use the libraries found in arduino-libraries in this repository,
     not any other version. It will not work with newer versions.
